Machine Learning Workshop (2-Day)

This repository contains files and code from the 2-day Machine Learning workshop I attended. The workshop covered essential machine learning concepts with practical implementations. Below are the main topics covered:

Topics Covered:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Techniques to handle missing data, scale features, and transform data.
2. Linear Regression: Implementing linear regression models for predicting outcomes.
3. Logistic Regression: Understanding and applying logistic regression for classification tasks.
4. Decision Trees: Building decision tree models for both classification and regression.

Practical Tasks:
- Insurance Dataset Task*: A real-world application using an insurance dataset to clean data and apply regression models for prediction.
- Jupyter Notebook*: All models and preprocessing steps were implemented using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library, as seen in the sklearn.ipynb notebook.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook sklearn.ipynb to explore the machine learning models and tasks
